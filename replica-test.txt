1. Check the Primary Node
Run the following SQL query on the primary PostgreSQL server to verify that the replica is connected and replication is in progress:


SELECT client_addr, state, sync_state, sent_lsn, write_lsn, flush_lsn, replay_lsn
FROM pg_stat_replication;

Key Fields to Observe:
client_addr: The IP address of the replica server.
state: The state of the replication process. It should show streaming.
sync_state: The synchronization state of the replica. Common values:
sync: Fully synchronized.
async: Asynchronous replication.
sent_lsn, write_lsn, flush_lsn, replay_lsn: These represent the replication log positions. The values should increment over time, indicating active replication.

2. Check the Replica Node
On the replica, run the following query to confirm that it is in standby mode and receiving updates from the primary:


SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();


Expected Result:
The result should be true, indicating that the server is in recovery mode and acting as a replica.

3. Check Replication Lag
Replication lag is the delay between the primary and replica in terms of applied WAL (Write-Ahead Log) entries.

On the replica, you can check the current WAL replay position with:


SELECT pg_last_xlog_replay_location();


Compare this with the sent_lsn from the pg_stat_replication query on the primary. A small difference indicates minimal lag.

4. Test Replication
You can perform a simple test by creating a new table or inserting a row into an existing table on the primary node and verifying its presence on the replica.

On the Primary:

CREATE TABLE replication_test (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, message TEXT);
INSERT INTO replication_test (message) VALUES ('Replication is working!');

On the Replica:
Check for the presence of the new table and row:

SELECT * FROM replication_test;

The table and data should appear on the replica if replication is functioning correctly.

5. Check Logs
Examine the PostgreSQL logs on both the primary and replica servers for any errors or warnings related to replication.

Primary Logs:
Check for messages confirming WAL files are being sent to the replica.

Replica Logs:
Check for messages confirming the receipt and application of WAL files.

On Linux, logs are typically located in /var/lib/postgresql/data/logs or a similar directory. Use docker logs <container_name> if running in Docker.

6. Advanced Verification
For a more detailed check, you can use replication-specific system functions:

Check Replication Slots (Primary):


SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

Look for active = true for your replication slot.

Check Replication Statistics (Primary):

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver;

This shows detailed information about the WAL receiver process.

Check the Replica Logs: Look for messages like:

LOG:  database system is ready to accept read-only connections
Verify Replication Status: From the primary, use:

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;

The output should list the replica, confirming that it is actively streaming from the primary.
